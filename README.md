# UKParliamentEndpoints
API which maintains a collection of public UK Parliament API endpoints.  
Designed to make it easier to discover public UK parliament data.  

The data is kept on a Azure Table, you need to add the relevant connecton string to config.  

WIP, currently has a single endpoint which returns a list of all stored endpoints.
